# Isotope Ratio Method (IRM)

This repository contains supplementary material for the manuscript Uncertainty Quantification of Plutonium Production Estimates Using the Isotope Ratio Method.
Several jupyter notebooks are provided to illustrate the methods we describe in the manuscript.
We cannot provide a complete, integrated implentation, since this would require the reactor simulation code `SERPENT 2`, which is not distributed with an open source license (http://montecarlo.vtt.fi).

## IRM Implementation
The jupyter notebook `irm_demonstration.ipynb` explains the IRM reconstruction procedure as we implemented it for the analysis presented in the manuscript. 
All functions defined in the notebook are also defined in the `average_batch_irm.py` file. 
Example data is provided to enable users to run the notebook in its current state.

## Cross-Section Uncertainty
The jupyter notebook `xs_uncertainty.ipynb` illustrates how the uncertainty intervals for the cross-section parameters were estimated.
It also shows how we transformed the unifromly distributed samples generated by the Sobol sequence into normally distributed samples for the cross-section parameters.

## Tolerance Intervals
The jupyter notebook `tolerance_intervals.ipynb` uses a subset of our data to illustrate how and why we calculate non-parametric tolerance intervals for the plutonium estimates.

## Senitivity Analysis
The `SALib` package was used to compute the global sensitivity indices.
Examples on how to use it can be found in the documentation (https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
It also provides an implementation of the Sobol sequence that can be used to input parameter samples.
