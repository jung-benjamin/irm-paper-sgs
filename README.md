# Isotope Ratio Method (IRM)

Supplementary material for the manuscript Uncertainty Quantification of Plutonium Production Estimates Using the Isotope Ratio Method.

## Specific Implementation of IRM
The jupyter notebook explains the IRM reconstruction procedure as we implemented it for the analysis presented in the above manuscript. 
All functions defined in the notebook are also defined in the `average_batch_irm.py` file. 
Example data is provided to enable users to run the notebook in its current state.

## What this repository does NOT (yet) contain
- Code for the uncertainty analysis presented in the manuscript
- Code for the sensitivity analysis presented in the manuscript
- Code for reactor simulations. We used `SERPENT 2`, which is not open source (http://montecarlo.vtt.fi).
